        "In this tutorial, we will be learning about Reinforcement Learning, a type of Machine Learning where an **agent** learns to choose **actions** in an **environment** that lead to maximal **reward** in the long run. RL has seen tremendous success on a wide range of challenging problems such as learning to play complex games like [Atari](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/agent57-outperforming-the-human-atari-benchmark), [StarCraft II](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii) and [Dota II](https://openai.com/five/) and [Go](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961).\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike fields like supervised learning, where we give examples of expected behaviour to our models, RL focuses on *goal-orientated* learning from interactions, through trial-and-error. RL algorithms learn what to do (i.e., which actions to take) in an environment to maximise some reward signal. In settings like a video game, the reward signal could be the score of the game, i.e., RL algorithms will try to maximise the score in the game by choosing the best actions.  \n",

        "More precisely, in RL we have an **agent** which perceives an **observation** $o_t$ of the current state $s_t$ of the **environment** and must choose an **action** $a_t$ to take. The environment then transitions to a new state $s_{t+1}$ in response to the agent's action and also gives the agent a scalar reward $r_t$ to indicate how good or bad the chosen action was given the environment's state. The goal in RL is for the agent to maximise the amount of reward it receives from the environment over time. The subscript $t$ is used to indicate the timestep number. In this tutorial we will only consider fully observable games, which means thet state of the environment and observation of the agent are the same.\n",

Note that the values in our observation tuple are continuous, while the size of a tensor are finite. *How to map the return of an action to all possible values of e.g. $x_c$?* We need to **discretize** continuous values by mapping them to intervals or bins $N_b$. Our final Q-table will consist in a 5-dimensional tensor of size $(N_{b^0}, N_{b^1}, N_{b^2}, N_{b^3}, |A|)$, the 5-th dimension is the number of actions $a \\in A$.\n",
