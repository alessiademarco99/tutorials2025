We'll start with an introduction to multimodal understanding that describes the main components of a Vision Lanugage Model. Then, we'll dive into Vision Transformer (ViT), a popular architecture which is used in VLMs as Image Encoder (Practical 1). It will be followed in Practical 2 which will dive into Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), a model for learning general representation from image-text pairs that can be used for a wide range of downstream tasks. We will also dive into different applications of CLIP. Finally, in Practical 3, we will actually use a pretrained VLM and do a finetuning to a given task.\n",

        "**Vision Language Models** (VLMs) are a class of models designed to jointly process and reason about visual and textual information. They are pre-trained on vast quantities of data containing sequences of images and text, typically with the objective of predicting subsequent text given the preceding multimodal context. This process enables them to learn rich, grounded representations connecting language to visual concepts. The pretraining task for VLMs is **Visual Question Answering** (VQA), where where given (potentially multiple) images and a question (text), one needs to provide an answer (subsequent text)."

        "**Visual Question Answering**. A key insight is that **Visual Question Answering** (VQA) can be viewed as a powerful, general-purpose interface for a wide range of vision tasks. By carefully crafting the input question, many distinct problems can be solved using the same underlying VLM architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the following examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Standard VQA**: The model answers a specific, open-ended question about the image content.\n",

        "**Image-Text Retrieval**: The model acts as a scorer to judge the alignment between an image and a potential description. This fundamental ability powers retrieval systems. By scoring a single image against a large database of candidate texts (or vice versa), the VLM can effectively retrieve the best matches.\n",
