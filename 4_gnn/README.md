## Practical 4: Graph Neural Networks
This is the M2L tutorial on Graph Neural Networks! In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of message passing by implement different types of GNN models (both from scratch and using the popular PyTorch Geometric library) across an array of different tasks and datasets. 

### Outline

- Section 1: Visualizing message passing with PyTorch
- Section 2: Implementing a GNN from scratch for node classification
- Section 3: Visualizing molecular data as graphs
- Section 4: Mini-batching for graph data
- Section 5: Implementing a GNN using PyTorch Geometric for graph regression
